= CIT

CIT aims to minimize the test cases while covering combinations of ECs.

- **1-wise testing:** Each EC is part of at least one test case.
- **Pairwise (2-wise) testing:** Covers all 2-way combinations of variable ECs.
- The **[[Greedy Set-Cover Algorithm]]** can be used to calculate a minimum number of test cases required to cover all pairs.
