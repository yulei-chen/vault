#testing 

- **Start as Early as Possible:** Testing is not just a late phase; the earlier a [[failure]] is found, the less the costs to fix it.
- **Clustering of Failures:** A small amount of modules often holds a high rate of overall failures (the **80:20 rule**). Test effort should be proportional to the expected failure density.
- **Pesticide Paradox:** Simply repeating tests brings no new information; tests must be checked, modified, and updated. Repetitions have no efficiency.
- **Fallacy:**（谬论） Assuming that finding no failures means the software is viable is a fallacy, as the software may still fail to fit the users' expectations.
