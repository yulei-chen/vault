#testing 

The program **is executed**.

- [[white-box testing]]
- [[black-box testing]]
- [[simulation]]
- [[prototyping]]


Often reveals [[failure]]s.

The resulting processes (from interpretation) are [[validation|validated]] against a document from the construction phases.

Procedures:
1. design tests
2. specify [[test case]]s
3. specify test process specification
	arrange test cases in executable order, taking pre- and post-conditions into account. This defines the order of tests and allows for automation.
4. text execution planning
	define the concrete order of execution, using criteria like regression testing, prioritization, and logical dependencies.
