#testing 

- **Inability to Prove Absence of Bugs:** "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!" (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1970).
- **Complete Testing is Not Possible:** For a program accepting three 16-bit integer inputs, performing a full test (testing possible combinations) at a speed of 100,000 combinations per second would take about **90 years**. This demonstrates that even a very simple program has many potential test cases.
