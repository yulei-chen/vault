A planar embedding of an ==abstract== graph $G = (V,E)$ is a ==bijective== mapping $f : V →V^′,$ where $G^′= (V^′,E^′)$ is a [[plane graph]] and $uv ∈E(G)$, then there is an edge in $E^′$ with endpoints $f(u)$ and $f(v)$, We say that $G^′$ is a drawing of $G$.

We shall not distinguish notational between the vertices of $G$ and $G^′$.

这是 A Problem Oriented Approach 一书中关于平面图最开始就引出的概念。
