#testing 

= component testing

**Environment:** Requires a **[[Driver]]** (calls services of the test object) and **Placeholder ([[Dummy]]/Stub)** (simulates services imported by the test object).

**Strategy and Responsibility:** Often performed by **developers** (developer test). Since source code is known, testing is often done as **[[white-box testing]]**.
