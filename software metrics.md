- **Product Measures**: Focus on system characteristics (e.g., Size, Complexity, [[Reliability]], [[changeability|Maintainability]]).
- **Project Measures:** Focus on resources (e.g., Number of developers, Price, Speed).
- **Process Measures:** Focus on development and maintenance (e.g., Duration, Effort, Cost, Failure reports, Number of releases).
- **Static Measures:** Measure a feature at a certain point in time.
- **Dynamic Measures:** Measure the development of a feature over time.

for example (in OOP):
