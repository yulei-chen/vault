NLP: Algorithms to process, analyze and understand texts in natural language
- Understanding structure
- Understanding meaning
## Challenges
- Ambiguity, e.g., bank
- Compositionality, e.g., green thumb
- Co-reference, e.g., if the **baby** does not like the **milk**, boil **it**
- Living language, e.g., Eyjafjallajökull
- Rare events

- Linguistics
- Machine learning
- NLP tasks:
	- Information Extraction + Retrieval
	- Summarization
	- Machine translation
	- Question Answering
	- Personal assistant
- NLP techniques (focus on deep learning-based):
	- Data types
	    - Texts, e.g., Brown Corpus, Penn Treebank
	    - Dictionaries/Ontologies, e.g., WordNet, GermaNet, EuroWordNet
	- Data grows
	    - English Text Corpora (News)
	    - Computer MT or ASR systems train on >> 1GWords. News Shuffle, GigaWord, Europarl, VideoLectures, …
	    - Human speaks 0.5 GigaWords in a Lifetime!
  - Model types
    - Classification, e.g., word sense disambiguation
    - Sequence Classification, e.g., sentiment analysis
    - Sequence labeling, e.g., named entity recognition
    - Sequence to Sequence model, e.g., summerization
    - Structure prediction, e.g., parsing
- Evaluation:
	- Human evaluation
	- Automatic evaluation
