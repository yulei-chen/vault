### 1. What's the concept metamodel

Metamodels are special models that make statements about the process of modelling. They describe the possible structure of other models. The originals that a metamodel represents are themselves models. Metamodels are usually **prescriptive**, meaning they are created before any originals exist, and the creation of these originals is called instantiation.

### 2. Define metamodels with their syntax and semantics

To completely specify a metamodel, its definition must cover four areas: abstract syntax, concrete syntax, static semantics, and dynamic semantics.

1.  **Abstract Syntax:** The abstract syntax definition describes the **structure of models**, specifying which constructs, properties, and relations a model consists of. This description is independent of how these constructs are visually presented.
2.  **Concrete Syntax:** This describes the **presentation** (e.g., graphical, textual, or file format) of the constructs defined in the abstract syntax. At least one concrete syntax definition is required, but there can be arbitrarily many.
3.  **Static Semantics:** This describes **modelling rules and constraints** (such as "no two stations may have the same name") that cannot be expressed in the abstract syntax definition. These constraints are often formulated using languages like OCL, and checking them should be a decidable problem.
4.  **Dynamic Semantics:** This describes the **meaning of the constructs**. This definition is often expressed in natural language, although it is possible to formally define dynamic semantics by mapping the metamodel to a formal language with defined semantics, such as finite automata or Petri nets.

### 3. What's modelling layers and distinguish them

Modelling layers represent the hierarchy between models and metamodels. Since a metamodel is itself a model, a metamodel for metamodels (a meta-metamodel) can be defined. In theory, an arbitrary number of layers can be constructed, but in practice, the most abstract layer will eventually become self-descriptive. Approaches exist with a fixed number of layers (e.g., UML) and with variable numbers (multi-level modelling).

The four layers often used, particularly in UML and MOF, are distinguished by what they represent or instantiate:
*   **M3 (Meta-Metamodel):** Contains concepts that define the structure of M2 (the metamodel layer), such as `Class` and `Attribute`. The MOF model is located here.
*   **M2 (Metamodel):** Contains concepts that define the structure of M1 (the user model layer), such as `Locomotive` or `Track vehicle`. UML 2 is an example of an M2 layer.
*   **M1 (Model):** Contains concrete instances that conform to the M2 structure, such as a specific `:Locomotive` with defined property values (e.g., `series=215`).
*   **M0 (Original):** Represents the artifacts or components of the real world being modelled (e.g., the actual train).

### 4. What's the foundations of UML and its relation to the MOF standard

UML (Unified Modelling Language) is an **OMG standard** that defines a metamodel for software engineering purposes. It is a standard specifying modeling concepts and their relations. It is a **graphical standard** that includes notational conventions and the UML Diagram Interchange format. While its specification includes semantics definitions in natural language, UML is **not** a metamodel with formally defined semantics. In version 2.5, UML unified its Superstructure (user-applied constructs) and Infrastructure (basic language constructs) into a single document.

UML's foundation is intrinsically linked to the **Meta-Object Facility (MOF)**:

1.  **MOF as the M3 Layer:** MOF is an OMG standard metadata architecture that serves as the **meta-metamodel (M3)** for UML.
2.  **MOF Specification:** MOF includes **Complete MOF (CMOF)**, which is the metamodel used to specify other metamodels, including UML 2.
3.  **Cyclic Dependency:** There is a cyclic dependency between CMOF and UML, as CMOF is built from Essential MOF (EMOF) and selected elements of the UML metamodel, and simultaneously, UML is specified by CMOF.

### 5. describe systems with the help of UML diagrams

UML diagrams are used to model systems, primarily in software engineering, though they can be applied to non-software domains. Key diagrams used to describe systems include:

*   **Class Diagrams:** Used to specify domain models and object-oriented designs, showing classes, attributes, operations, and relationships like associations and inheritance.
*   **Object Diagrams:** Used to describe the system at a specific point in time by showing instances of classes (instance specifications) and the links between these instances.
*   **Use Case Diagrams:** Used to specify the functional requirements of a system, detailing actors (users) and the use cases (functions) they interact with.
*   **Activity Diagrams:** Illustrate the flow of an operation or a workflow by showing activities, actions, and control flow.
*   **Sequence Diagrams:** Describe the time-ordered message interactions and collaborations between objects or components (lifelines) in a system.
*   **Component Diagrams:** Describe the system's high-level physical structure by showing components (such as `WebUI` or `UserManagement`) and their dependencies.
