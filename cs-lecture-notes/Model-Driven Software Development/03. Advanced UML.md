### 1. How to apply the extension mechanisms UML profiles and stereotypes

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) utilizes profiles and stereotypes as built-in extension mechanisms because UML, while a general-purpose language, is not ideal for all purposes.

**UML Profiles:** A profile is applied to extend a reference metamodel (such as UML) or to adapt it to a specific platform, domain, or method.

- **Definition and Constraint:** A profile is a package that extends elements of the type Metaclass and may add additional constraints. Profiles are intrinsically tied to a reference metamodel created using the Meta Object Facility (MOF) (e.g., UML or PCM) and cannot be defined as standalone packages.
- **Application:** Profile application is a type of package import. One or more profiles can be applied to a package. Profiles are optional, but if application is mandatory, the keyword `{required}` can be used.
- **Content:** A profile can contain data types, classes, stereotypes, primitive types, and enumerations. It also has the ability to re-use or extend parts of other profiles.

**UML Stereotypes:** Stereotypes are considered the most crucial extension elements.

- **Definition:** A stereotype is defined as a class within the profiles package that specifies how a class in the reference metamodel can be extended.
- **Application (Extension):** When a profile is applied, the stereotypes it contains may be applied to classes. The application of a stereotype to a class is specifically termed _extension_, and it is graphically represented by a solid, filled arrow.
- **Properties:** Stereotypes can include attributes, which are referred to as _tags_. The corresponding values of a stereotype instance are known as _tagged values_. Stereotypes cannot be extended by other stereotypes.

### 2. Judge in which case either an extension of the UML metamodel or the creation of a separate metamodel makes sense

The decision between extending the existing UML metamodel via profiles or creating a separate custom MOF-based metamodel often positions profiles as a middle path.

**Creating a UML Profile (Extension):** Profiles are considered a "light-weight" method for adapting and extending existing metamodels at level M2. This approach is advantageous when:

- **Reuse is prioritized:** Concepts such as components, classes, and others can be reused from the existing UML structure.
- **Validity is critical:** Models remain valid UML instances. The semantics of UML are also valid for the extended models.
- **Dynamic Application:** Profiles can be applied dynamically to models.
- **Tool Compatibility:** Existing UML tools can still be utilized for modeling the extended models.

**Creating a Custom Metamodel:** This approach is necessary when greater flexibility and complete freedom in modeling are required.

- **High Flexibility:** Custom metamodels offer more flexibility compared to profiles.
- **Total Freedom:** They provide total freedom in modeling.

**Drawbacks and Judgment:**

- **Profile Limitations:** Profiles offer lower flexibility because all concepts of UML are still inherited and remain valid, even if those concepts have no meaning within the specific domain being modeled. Furthermore, profiles cannot modify existing metamodels; they can only extend them via stereotypes.
- **Custom Metamodel Limitations:** This approach leads to little re-use, meaning concepts (like the component concept) must be re-defined entirely.

Ultimately, there is no universal guideline for this decision; rather, it hinges entirely on the specific set of adaptations necessary for the existing reference metamodel.

### 3. What's the basic structure of UML 2.4

The basic structure of UML 2.4 is defined within the **UML Infrastructure Library**. This library defines a meta-language core that is employed to define UML itself and other related metamodels.

The Infrastructure Library consists of two core packages:

1. **Core:** Contains the basic concepts necessary for metamodeling. The `Core` package is further divided into several sub-packages:
    
    - **PrimitiveTypes:** Defines pre-defined types such as `Boolean`, `Integer`, `String`, and `UnlimitedNatural`.
    - **Basic:** Contains central notions like package, class, operation, and attribute.
    - **Abstractions:** Includes concepts such as instantiation, generalization, cardinality, and restriction.
    - **Constructs:** Contains the base concept of association.
2. **Profiles:** Contains the necessary mechanisms for adaptation.
    

This architecture ensures the architectural alignment of MOF, UML, and XMI (used for exchanging models).

### 4. What are UML generalization techniques, and you can apply them

UML generalization techniques center on **Generalization Sets**, which define specific partitions of generalization associations. Generalization (or Inheritance) is a taxonomic relation where a more special classifier inherits all features of the more general classifier, meaning every instance of the special classifier is also an indirect instance of the general classifier.

There are four partitionings available in UML 2 that can be used within a Generalization Set:

|Generalization Set Partitioning|Description|Default Status|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**overlapping**|It is permitted to create further subclasses using multiple inheritance.|Default|
|**disjoint**|It is _not_ permitted to create further subclasses using multiple inheritance.|Not default|
|**complete**|All possible subclasses have been specified.|Not default|
|**incomplete**|Some subclasses have been specified, but others are possible.|Default|

**Application of Generalization Sets:** Generalization sets are utilized to model inheritance hierarchies that possess multiple dimensions and precise restrictions.

For instance, consider a `Locomotive` class:

1. **Motive Power:** The first dimension, `motive power`, might partition `Locomotive` into `Steam Locomotive` and `Motor Locomotive`. This set could be labeled `{disjoint, complete}` to indicate that a locomotive must belong to exactly one of these two categories.
2. **Motor Type:** The `Motor Locomotive` class could then be partitioned by `motor type` into `Electric Locomotive` and `Internal Combustion Locomotive`. This set might be labeled `{overlapping, complete}`, indicating that while all types are specified, a locomotive could potentially belong to both (e.g., a hybrid locomotive).

### 5. What are UML power types

A power type is defined as **a class whose instances are subclasses**.

- **Inspiration:** The concept was derived from the mathematical notion of a power set, which is a set whose instances are subsets.
- **Relation to Generalization Sets:** A Generalization Set can optionally be linked to a type, and this type is then referred to as a power type.
- **Function:** The instances of this power type are the subclasses of the class that the generalization set describes in further detail.
- **Layer Limitation:** Power types are useful because they can help circumvent the restriction inherent in modeling with four layers (M0–M3).

The UML specification acknowledges the definition but does not provide an explanation on how to implement or check the power type mechanism.
