#theorem 

Let $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ be internally disjoint [[arc]]s that have the same endpoints. Then

1. $\mathbb{R} \backslash (P_1 ∪P_2 ∪P_3)$ has exactly three [[region]]s with [[bound|boundaries]] $P_1 ∪P_2$, $P_1 ∪P_3$ and $P_2 ∪P_3$, respectively.
2. Let $P$ be an arc from the [[interior of arc|interior of]] $P_1$ to the interior of $P_3$ whose interior lies in the region of $\mathbb{R} \backslash (P_1 ∪P_3)$ containing the interior of $P_2$. Then $P$ contains a point of $P_2$.
