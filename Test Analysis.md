#testing 


Answers: **“What is tested?”**. Specifies concrete [[test condition]]s/criteria based on documents specifying requirements (the test basis). Reviews the test basis (requirements, architecture, etc.). Defines and prioritizes test conditions for every identified feature. Establishes bidirectional [[traceability]] between features and related test conditions.
