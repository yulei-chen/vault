#testing 

- **Effort in Reality:** Testing effort typically constitutes **25% - 50% of the total development effort**. Successful testing (finding [[failure|failures]]) reduces the overall development costs.
- **Prioritizing Test Cases:** Testing is restricted by resources, especially time. Test cases must therefore be prioritized.
- **Prioritization Basis:** Prioritization can be based upon **Expected failure severity**, **Probability of occurrence**, or the combination of both (Risk = failure severity * probability of occurrence). Priorities must be modifiable.
