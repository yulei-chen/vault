For any graph $G= (V,E)$ the following are equivalent:

$G$ is a [[tree]], that is, 
1. $G$ is connected and acyclic.
2. $G$ is connected, but for any $e∈E$ in $G$ the graph $G−e$ is not connected.
3. $G$ is acyclic, but for any $x,y ∈V(G)$, $xy \notin E(G)$ the graph $G+ xy$ has a cycle.
4. G is [[connected]] and [[1-degenerate]].
5. G is connected and $|E|= |V|−1$.
6. G is acyclic and $|E|= |V|−1$.
7. G is connected and every non-trivial subgraph of $G$ has a vertex of degree at most 1.
8. Any two vertices are joined by a unique path in $G$.
