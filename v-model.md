= Sequential Development Model

The V-Model connects [[development phases]] on the left branch (Construction Phases) with [[testing phases]] on the right branch (Test Phases).

**Key Points:**

- The steps on the right branch represent **[[test execution]]**.
- Associated [[Test Planning|test preparation]] (planning, specification) starts earlier and runs **parallel** to the development steps.
- The rule of thumb is that **finding [[failure]]s on the same level of abstraction on which they are created is easiest**.
