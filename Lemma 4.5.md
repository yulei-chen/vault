Let $G$ be a [[plane graph]] and $e$ be an edge of $G$. Then the following hold.

- The [[frontier]] $X$ of a [[face]] of $G$ either contains $e$ or is disjoint from the interior of $e$.
- If $e$ is on a [[cycle]] in $G$, then $e$ is on the frontier of exactly two faces.
- If $e$ is on no cycle in $G$, then $e$ is on the frontier of exactly one face.
- If $G$ is a plane [[forest]], it has exactly one face.

- If $G$ is 2-connected, then each face is [[bound]]ed by a cycle.
